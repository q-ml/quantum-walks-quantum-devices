This folder contains the codes that we have used.
The file 'CTQW.ipynb'contains code that we used for implementing an n-dimentional hypercube on a device by giving unitary evolution to individual qubits.
The file 'U3 n CNOT's.ipynb'contains code that we used for obtaining graphs with perfect transport by building shallow circuits with U3-gates on some qubits and CNOT on some of them.
The file 'X_CNOT_ext.ipynb'contains code that we used for obtaining graphs with perfect transport by building shallow circuits with X and CNOT gates being applied on random qubits.
