This folder contains data collected from running a CTQW on a 65-qubit IBM quantum computer named 'ibmq_manhattan'. 
The file 'X_65'contains output data from a run that creates a walk on a 65-dimensional hypercube. 
The file 'X_65_h'contains output data from a run that creates creates a superposition of all bit strings(i.e., a superposition of 2^50 amplitudes with equal weights).
