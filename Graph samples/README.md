This folder contains graphs of perfect transport that we obtained by implementing shallower circuits in the quantum device. For example, the file 'X_CX_2q.nb' 
contains graphs that are implemented using X and CNOT gates on a 2-qubit device and the file 'U3_CX_4q.nb' contains graphs that are implemented using U3 and 
CNOT gates on a 4-qubit device.
